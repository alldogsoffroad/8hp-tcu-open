# Spec 03 — SPI devices and transfer schedule

Status: **draft.** Bus, chip-select, frame format and transfer structure are established; device
part numbers and full register semantics are **open**.
Markers: **[M]** manual, **[O]** observed in stock firmware, **[I]** inference.

## 1. Buses in use

| Bus | RSPI unit | DMA channels (RX/TX) | Chip selects used | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | RSPI-A (`0xFFFFB000`) | 56 / 57 [M] | SSLA0, SSLA1, SSLA2, SSLA3, SSLA5 | SSLA4 pin is configured but never asserted [O] |
| 1 | RSPI-B (`0xFFFFB800`) | 58 / 59 [M] | SSLB0, SSLB1, SSLB2 | also used directly by the CPU at boot and in the shutdown path [O] |
| — | RSPI-C (`0xFFFFC000`) | 60 / 61 | none | pins are configured as RSPI-C, but the unit is only ever disabled [O] |

## 2. Electrical / framing parameters (all jobs)

From the SPCMD words used (`0xAFx1`, one job `0xAF20`) [O], decoded per manual §17.3.12 [M]:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Frame length | 16 bits |
| Bit order | MSB first |
| Mode | CPOL = 0, CPHA = 1 (SPI mode 1); **except** the SSLB2 job: CPOL = 0, CPHA = 0 (mode 0) |
| Chip select | asserted per frame, released after each frame (SSLKP = 0) |
| Clock delay / next-access delay | enabled, programmed per bus (SPCKD / SPND) |
| Bit rate | SPBR = 5, BRDV = 0 → **Pφ / 12**; Pφ (peripheral clock) is open (spec 05) |

## 3. Transfer mechanism (behavior to reproduce)

- Transfers are organised as **jobs**. A job names a bus, a frame count, a sequence of up to 8
  per-frame commands (chip select + format), a transmit buffer and a receive buffer, and a
  completion handler [O].
- The SPI unit runs the command sequence repeatedly until the frame count is reached; A-DMAC feeds
  the transmit data register and drains the receive data register [O][M].
- On bus 0, every job addresses **all five chips in a fixed order**: SSLA3, SSLA2, SSLA1, SSLA0,
  SSLA5. Frame *n* goes to chip *n mod 5* [O].
- A job scheduler queues jobs per bus and starts the next job from the completion interrupt [O].
  Each job record carries an integrity marker that is checked before use; a mismatch is reported as
  an internal error [O].

## 4. Frame format of the bus-0 devices (and SSLB1)

Every 16-bit frame is `[command byte][data byte]` [O]:

- Command bytes with **bit 7 set are writes**; the data byte (or low bits of the frame) carries
  per-chip values from the software's state for that chip [O].
- Command bytes with bit 7 clear are reads [O].
- Command `0x06` is an **identification read**. A valid reply has high byte `0xA2`; the low byte
  of two consecutive replies is stored as the chip's ID [O].

### 4.1 Bus-0 jobs (5 chips each)

| Job | Frames | Commands sent per chip, in order | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| ID | 10 | `0x06`, `0x00` | read identification; reply must start `0xA2` |
| Diagnostic read | 15 | `0x18`, `0x1E`, `0x28` | [I] status / fault registers |
| Configuration | 40 | `0x8E`, `0x90`, `0x96`, `0x88` (writes), then `0x28`, `0x30`, `0x2E`, `0x36` (reads) | [I] configure and read back |
| Cyclic control | 45 | `0x88`, `0xA0`, `0xE8`, `0xA6`, `0xF0`, `0x60`, `0xC0`, `0x66`, `0xD8` | [I] per-cycle setpoint update and status |

In the cyclic job, frames 3 and 5 for each chip (commands `0xE8` and `0xF0`) carry a full 16-bit
per-chip value OR-ed into the command template [O]. [I] These are most likely **two current
setpoints per chip**, i.e. about **10 current-controlled solenoid channels** across the five
bus-0 chips. Confirmed as current setpoints; channel use and solenoid assignment in spec 12.

### 4.2 Bus-1 jobs

| Chip | Commands observed | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SSLB1 | `0x06` (ID), `0x28`, `0x2E` (reads), `0x90`, `0x8E` (writes), plus a 7-frame and a 4-frame job | same command family as the bus-0 chips → [I] a sixth driver of the same type |
| SSLB0 | `0x03`, `0x09`, `0xC9`, … interleaved with SSLB1 frames | different device; [I] role open |
| SSLB2 | one 16-bit frame, SPI mode 0 | different device; [I] role open |

## 5. Shutdown behavior

On a fatal internal condition the software reinitialises RSPI-B, sends a frame on SSLB1 from the
CPU, and then deliberately stops in an endless loop [O]. [I] The design relies on an external
device (watchdog / supervisor) to cut the outputs and reset the controller. A reimplementation
must provide an equivalent fail-safe path.

## 6. Open items

1. **Identify the chips.** The firmware does not name them. The reliable route is physical:
   photograph the markings of the ICs on a spare controller board. Their datasheets then define
   the full register set — and they are the best source for driver behavior.
2. Map each driver channel (chip, channel) to a transmission solenoid (needs spec 02 timers and
   the shift-control analysis, or bench measurement).
3. Decode the per-chip state record (28 bytes per chip in RAM) fields that feed the write frames.
4. Job timing: rate of the cyclic job and its relation to the control loop.
5. Roles of SSLB0 and SSLB2.
